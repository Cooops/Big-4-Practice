# Big-4-Practice
Repository for measuring my progress learning Computer Science fundamentals (title is just flashy).

## Why are you doing this?
I want to improve my fundamental knowledge over the course of the next 6-12 months, rounding out any core Computer Science (mainly Data Structures & Algorithms) related information I am lacking. This will be a long-term venture with plenty of notes, videos, articles, and of course code samples along the way. I will start out coding in Python, but will likely blend in C-related langauges down the line. I am doing this for myself first and foremost; not anyone else.
